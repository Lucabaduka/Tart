          Endotarting is when a World Assembly nation endorses every other World Assembly nation in their region. I'ts the
          fastest way to get endorsed back, and a great way to increase everyone's influence. You can use this site to input
          your nation and region, then get a list of everyone you haven't endorsed as of the last databse update. The database
          updates daily at 01:00 PDT. The data could be up to one day old if NationStates did not have any new data for us by
          then.

      <details class="subbox">
        <summary class="title blue">Why Endorsements Matter<hr class="mt-2"></summary>
        <p class="space">
          For most regions, influence is a great boon. In addition to providing you another potential gold 1% census badge,
          it's also a vital component of regional security. When a region loses its Governor, the region's World Assembly
          Delegate will gain executive authority over the region and be able to control almost all aspects of its administration.
          Since the Delegate is whichever nation has the most endorsements, a region can become hijacked by a coordinated,
          hostile takeover with little to no notice. In these takeovers, it is possible for invaders to destroy the region
          and all of its posts and history.
        </p>
        <p class="space">
          One saving grace is that while a Governor may ban nations for free, an invader must spend influence to do it. For
          Delegates, the cost is half what the nation they want to ban has. Therefore, the more influence a native nation has,
          the harder it is to ban them. Influence in non-frontier regions never decays, so the earlier you start sending and
          receiving endorsements, the more influence you can build up to protect yourself and your region. This technique is
          called an Influence Fortress, and is one of the best methods of ensuring that your region is never destroyed.
        </p>
        <p class="space">
          Be aware that some regions have limits on how many endorsements a nation can legally have. You may wish to check if
          your region is one with such limits.
